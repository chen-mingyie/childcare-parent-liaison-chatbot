## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

<div style="text-align: justify"> Liaison work between a service provider and a consumer is a common task that is primarily undertaken by a human worker. However, our team saw the potential for RPA to aide in a human liaison officer so long as we could capture the human thought process and the workflow. We set our eyes on the liaison tasks in childcare centers, because as parents of toddlers ourselves, we had experienced first-hand the amount of work that the center needed to go through with anxious parents, many of whom, had many queries for the center. <br>
The job scope of a liaison officer in a childcare center is wide but for project purpose we had scoped it to address the repetitive, ad-hoc, and mundane tasks involved in the open-house invitation. Our team created two bots to aid the human worker.<br>
An email bot was chosen as we felt invitations sent through email held a more official and professional outlook compared to, say, text messages. This software robot handled the tasks of sending out email invites informing parents of the month’s open house dates, gathering parent’s availabilities on the dates, informing parents of their allocated open house slot, and sending out appropriate reminder emails. The email bot was also designed to attend to ad-hoc requests (e.g. change requests for allocated slots) however we felt that ad-hoc communication through emails was not common, instead a messaging app was more appropriate due to it greater accessibility.
A chatbot was thus created to handle ad-hoc requests, as it was, in general, more natural for an individual to turn to messaging apps for day-to-day ad-hoc communications. The tasks fulfilled by the chatbot included: editing availabilities, handling requests for change of allocated open-house slots, handling enquiries regarding allocated slot or availability, and other basic general enquiries.<br>
To realize our ideas, we had used a variety of tools, and packages. UiPath was used to put together the email bot, while python + DialogFlow + Telegram formed our chatbot. With these, our bots could aid in the end-to-end task of liaising with parents from invitation till their attendance on actual event day.
